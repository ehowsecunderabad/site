[TITLE] Come, Ye that love the Lord

[Verse 1]
Come, Ye that love the Lord,
And let your joys be known,
Join in a song with sweet accord,
And thus surround the throne.

[Chorus 1]
We're marching to Zion,
Beautiful, beautiful Zion;
We're marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.

[Verse 2]
Let those refuse to sing
Who never knew our God;
But children of the heavenly King
Must speak their joys abroad.

[Verse 3]
The hill of Zion yields
A thousand sacred sweets,
Before we reach the heavenly fields,
Or walk the golden streets.

[Verse 4]
The men of grace have found;
Glory begun below,
Celestial fruit on earthly ground,
From faith and hope may grow.

[Verse 5]
Then let our songs abound,
And every tear be dry;
We're marching through Immanuel's ground,
To fairer worlds on high.
